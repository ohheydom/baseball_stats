# Baseball Stats

A step by step analysis of an MLB dataset downloaded from [Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com). The dataset is located [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/the-history-of-baseball). In order to run the ipython notebook without any modifications, you'll need to download the entire dataset into a folder entitled `baseball`.

I created this as somewhat of a tutorial for pandas DataFrames. Instead of working with terms like "foo" and "bar" like most tutorials do, I figured it'd be much more beneficial to work with a real dataset.

## Usage

In order to use the ipython notebook on your own computer, you'll need to install the IPython Notebook package. More information can be found [here](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).
